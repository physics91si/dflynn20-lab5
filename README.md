### trig.py

* Very good!

### data_analysis.py

* Good!
* I wasn't able to run your code at first as there were a couple lines where you used tabs instead of spaces, so python complained, but that was the only problem
  * In emacs, at least, you can fix this with the command `M-x whitespace-cleanup` (namely `Option-x` and then you type `whitespace-cleanup`)
